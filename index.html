      <h2>What is TerribleHack?</h2>
      <p>Most hackathons are about coming up with innovative new ideas and making plausible startup prototypes. This one is different. This one is about having fun! <strong>Take some time to make your bad ideas a reality.</strong></p>
      
      <p>Take a look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCznbFDr2mhqFBadguRnG8Hg/videos">past demos on YouTube</a> or one of <a href="https://terriblehack-xiii.devpost.com/">our</a> <a href="https://terriblehack6.devpost.com/">many</a> <a href="https://terriblehack-xi.devpost.com/">old</a> <a href="https://terriblehack-x.devpost.com/">Devposts</a> for inspiration.</p>

      <h2>Who are we?</h2>
      <p>We started Terriblehack in 2015. We were young students at the University of Waterloo, eager to temporarily break away from the pressure and professionalism of traditional hackathons. We wanted some dedicated time to mix humour and technical savvy and to share the results with our friends. The result was the first TerribleHack, and in the past five years, the tradition has continued.</p>

      <p>We are now University of Waterloo graduates, joined by current students and friends. Now that time and space have no meaning, we're here to send you some much-needed levity over the wire with our first online TerribleHack!</p>
