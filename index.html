      <h3>Our vision has always been to create a TerribleHack that is entirely memes. One so immersive the event itself disappears into the experience. And so intelligent it can respond to a tap, your voice and even a glance. With TerribleHack X, that vision is now a reality. Say hello to the future. Also <a data-scroll href="#pricing">help pay for food!</a></h3>

      <p>With no charging cable required, TerribleHack X is truly designed for the future of wireless. Simply place your TerribleHack X in the garbage and order a new one, and you'll be good to go with a full charge. The future is now.</p>

      <h2>TerribleHack 8</h2>
      <p>We released a less-featured TerribleHack at the same time to cannibalize our own sales. Our top economists proved that this would yield the maximum disruption. The proof is trivial and is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>
