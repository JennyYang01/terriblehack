      <h3>Our vision has always been to create a Terriblehack that is entirely memes. One so immersive the event itself disappears into the experience. And so intelligent it can respond to a tap, your voice and even a glance. With Terriblehack X, that vision is now a reality. Say hello to the future.</h3>
